<p>This week's project is a continuation from last week's story in the form of "day 2 on the island.  In order to include all the required elements, I chose to have the main character meet an another survivor.  The stranger asks how the bananas taste, and if he can have some.  Using boolean method and a function method, he describes the banana's flavors and either shares his bananas or not, depending on the mood boolean. They also look for other survivors, but only find three casualties; Larry, Moe, and Curly.  Then using a nested while loop, they dig graves and bury the casualites.</p>
<p>This project was a little more tough, having to create both the flowchart, the story, and the code.  However, the project was very enjoyable</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the next project.  I hope you enjoy this one!</p>
