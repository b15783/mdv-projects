<p>For project 2, I chose to create a scenario of a person waking up on a deserted island and not knowing how he got there.  He may have been on a flight that crashed.  His first realization is that is either day or night.  He then perceives that he is hot or cold, depending on how much clothing he has left on.  After that, his first instinct is to gather food. So he starts gathering and eating bananas.  After he's done eating and evaluating the different banana colors, he begins to discover the different animal species that are with him on his new island.</p>
<p>I chose this scenario because I am a huge fan of the television show "Lost".  I have seen all six seasons more than once.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
